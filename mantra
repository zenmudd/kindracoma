#mantra

love
is what you claim
you come to bring
with the gun in your arms
it's bringing me down

fright
it is the hateress in your eyes
make you mad make you blind
denile
I'm turning around
as there 
are

		ignorance
		pasion
		goodness
		it's all there in you

		love
		care
		serenity
		all you need to do

mind
that's full of 
primal rage will lead
to the abbyss inside
and spread it around

doubt
is the most dangerous sins
of all
kills the will of you mind
rejoice
and free up your heart
despite
fright

		ignorance
		pasion
		goodness
		it's all there in you

		love
		care
		serenity
		all you need to do
