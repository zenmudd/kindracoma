#mantra

Verse 1:

Hey
You seem to overestimate
The deadlines of your aim
and its bringing you down

Frame
Its just another frame of life
Blurs your attention away
Mirror
You’re so right

Verse 2:

Try
To make it clearly understood
The desires of you mind
And drop it away

Hate
Is the most dangerous sins of all
Killing will of your mind
Mirror
You’re so right

Chorus:

ignorance, passion, goodness
It’s all there in you
love, care, serenity
All you need to do
