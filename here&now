I am here and now
Where you don't want to be found
Crossing the fingers to let
you out

Night is the same as the day
Choked up and thrown away
You still pretend that you love
Life, right


I will pretend that I care
Show you around, what is near
Here is the moment of truth 
For you

There's only one thing to know
Now - is the moment to go
Now - is the only consept
To make sence, yeah
