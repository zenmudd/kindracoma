I am here and now
Where you don't want to be found
Crossing the fingers to let
you out

Night is the same as the day
Choked up and thrown away
You still pretend that you love
Life, right


I will pretend that I care
Show you around, what is near
Here is the moment of truth 
For you

There's only one thing to know
Now - is the moment to go
Now - is the only consept
To make sence, yeah


From this moment now on
You may stay where you are
Any place is felt like home yeah
Cause now your mind is fully present

From this spot you fully are aware
Increase the energies wthin you
Say hello to the presence of your mind
And when you go down
You'll find the way out with instincts of your body
