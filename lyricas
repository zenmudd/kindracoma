#undressed

Write it down
And put up the wall
The cells of your body 
Are mine after all

Energies
Accumulate
The beauty inside with 
My voice to let go

Fuel the fire
We take off the ground
Be now prepared 
To expand endless times

Flash to flash
Your mind is my mind
I need not to listen
As you speak with my rhymes

You are my pride
I'm on your side

State of your mind
Leaves me undressed
I give you the access to my inner space

Help me if I
Jump off the road
Passwords are unlocked, we're on the same boat

love
is what you claim
you come to bring
with the gun in your arms
it's bringing me down

fright
it is the hateress in your eyes
make you mad make you blind
denile
I'm turning around
as there 
are

		ignorance
		pasion
		goodness
		it's all there in you

		love
		care
		serenity
		all you need to do

mind
that's full of 
primal rage will lead
to the abbyss inside
and spread it around

doubt
is the most dangerous sins
of all
kills the will of you mind
rejoice
and free up your heart
despite
fright

		ignorance
		pasion
		goodness
		it's all there in you

		love
		care
		serenity
		all you need to do
