# peace proclamation

If you complain to be unwanted
I'll never bother you again, do it yourself
These never wanted to be fronted
Unless if you will pretend

The endless war leads to the abbyss
Of broken homes and broken hearts, out of life line
The consequnces for the figthers
Lays in the demage of their minds

If prophesy could be exacted
To all around what's going on
Then total chaos dissociated
And peace would come all around

You are my majesty
