#peaceProclamation

Verse 1:

If you complain to be unwanted
I'll never bother you again, do it yourself
These never wanted to be fronted
Unless if you would pretend

The truth is valued over money
The mind is pure when you’re awake, out of the box
There’s nothing wrong to take a step-back
And slow it down like do rocks

Verse 2: 

Determinations makes no meaning
And round and round
The endless game
There’s someones will that’s overwhelming
You act to give it a name

If prophesy could be exacted
To all around what's going on
Then total chaos dissociated
And peace would come all around

You are my majesty
