Sober mind is
Set to see things 
As is

Out of
The box 
Gradients
Are mixed up

Lines are
Drawn by
Expectations
That increase

———-

I would’t want to
Stay the same place
For long

Clean enough to
Feel it’s safe if
I go wrong

————-

Limits
Only
Exist
In the

Mind that’s
Indoor
Nothing comes
Unless you try

———-
I’m the inner voice to make you think beyond the box
And take you far

Cross the borders
