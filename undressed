#undressed

Write it down
And put up the wall
The cells of your body 
Are mine after all

Energies
Accumulate
The beauty inside with 
My voice to let go

Fuel the fire
We take off the ground
Be now prepared 
To expand endless times

Flash to flash
Your mind is my mind
I need not to listen
As you speak with my rhymes

You are my pride
I'm on your side

State of your mind
Leaves me undressed
I give you the access to my inner space

Help me if I
Jump off the road
Passwords are unlocked, we're on the same boat
