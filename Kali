Verse1:

Bold and naked
You only overcome
Final destination once per lifetime

Leave the treasures
Your experience is
Indisputable

But keep in mind
That the moment might come
Anytime
So be aware where you are
Until you let it go out

Verse 2:

Have look around
And make sure 
What you see 
Is what you want to see 
When youâ€™re done
Before you rise again

Check every step
Each compress 
Every line that you draw
On your picture of life
Until you let it go out
