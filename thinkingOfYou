# thinking of you

I am only here 'till you're thinking of me
Merge of your ideas to reality as you seem to know
Overwrite the paterns of the variety being
I am only here 'till you're thnking of me

Thing will only happen if you point it out
Assembled of the feelings you associate with your mind identity
But here's a small example of what you have to know
You will never die beacuse you were never born

So when the ooposites collide
It breaks the blocks and open gates
And bring the life
In differents forms
And different shapes
And as you recognise the cause
You learn to understand that
I am only here 'till you're thinking of me
